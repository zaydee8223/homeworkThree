This week, our assignment was to create a form that would allow users to input information about a student, and retrieve the data and display it from local storage. The application provides a student's name, age, email address, and an array of classes the student is taking.
The main goals of this assignment were: 
- Understand how to display and retrieve data using localStorage
- Use JSON stringify and parse to get the data
- Add a student to the local storage with name, age, phone, email address, and an array of classes
- Create a button that will display the data on the page

Features:
- Name, Age, Email Address, Classes input
- All information displayed
- Information memorized using local storage

To utilize the app, enter a student's first and last name, age, email address, and classes (separated by a comma). Click the "Add Student Information" button to store it. Then, hit the "Remember Students" button, and view all of the students you saved with local storage!
